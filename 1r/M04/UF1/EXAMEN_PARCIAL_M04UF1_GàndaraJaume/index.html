                <div id="sun"></div>
                <p class="info">NASA has shared an image of the sun "smiling", after one of their satellites captured patterns on its surface appearing to show a happy face.</p>
                <p class="info">The US space agency posted the images on social media, writing: "NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the sun 'smiling.' Seen in ultraviolet light, these dark patches on the Sun are known as coronal holes and are regions where fast solar wind gushes out into space."</p>
                <p class="info">People were quick to make comparisons with a variety of characters and objects, including the Teletubbies baby, the Ghostbusters Stay Puff marshmallow man, a biscuit, a lion and a pumpkin.</p>
